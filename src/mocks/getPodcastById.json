      "description": "Ten years ago, Daft Punk’s Random Access Memories gave life back to music. The world-beating smash “Get Lucky” broke streaming records, forged a retro sound that still dominates the charts, and paved the way for artists like The Weeknd, Dua Lipa and Lizzo to craft their own throwback hits. How did Daft Punk do it? Switched On Pop’s four part-mini series Listening 2: Daft Punk unlocks the sounds, voices, and stories across all four of the group’s studio albums. On their first album, Homework, Daft Punk stretched the boundaries of electronic music and began wiring the circuits that would become their robot alter-egos, asking a fundamental question: where does the human end and the machine begin?\n\nSongs Discussed\n\n​​Daft Punk - Give Life Back to Music\n\nDaft Punk - Get Lucky (feat.

      "description": "When trouble strikes in music town, there’s one guy who gets the call. That’s me, Joe Treble, forensic musicologist. This week, I've got one of the most shocking cases I've ever worked. Someone killed the key change in pop music, and I’m going to do whatever it takes to find the perpetrator.\nThe key change used to be at large on the Billboard charts. From the 1950s to the 1990s, 20-30% of all number one hits featured one. In Whitney Houston’s “I Wanna Dance With Somebody,\" the key change hits right before the final chorus. The song’s harmonic center shifts up, raising the pitch of the song, challenging the vocalist to hit higher and higher notes, juicing the big finish with excitement and pep. But starting in the 1990s the key change virtually disappeared from the Hot 100. Now, hit songs start and end in the same key, and no one seems to have even noticed. Except for me.\nThis investigation will bring me face to face with a rogue's gallery of suspects and sources: Chris Dalla Riva, music and data specialist; Brandon McFarland, alias 1-O.A.K., producer; Emily King, singer and songwriter. Each interrogation brings me closer to revealing the murderer, but will I be able to handle the terrible truth? Tune in as I tackle the hardest case of my career: the case of the missing key change!\n\nSongs Discussed\nEmily King - Georgia Sleepwalker, Medal, The Way that You Love Me\nYG, Kamaiyah, RJ, Mitch, Ty Dolla $ign - Do Yo Dance (feat. Kamaiyah, RJ, Mitch, Ty Dolla $ign)\nBeyoncé - Love On Top\nBon Jovi - Livin' On A Prayer\nWhitney Houston - I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\nFrank Sinatra - Strangers In The Night\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "We have an emergency podcast drop because the biggest and fastest moving story on the internet right now is about a song called “Heart On My Sleeve.” The track sounds like it was made by the producer Metro Boomin featuring Drake and The Weeknd. It might be one of the most consequential songs in music history because it was actually a fake, made with artificial intelligence. The blowback from this song has been enormous and a bit confusing. So host Charlie Harding went on The Vergecast podcast to break down how this song was likely made, and what it might mean for the music industry, the tech industry and all of our intellectual property. \n\n\nListen to the whole episode on The Vergecast\n\n\nRead Alex Cranz's story on Laser Bongs on The Verge\n\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "The South Korean idol group BTS is one of the biggest musical sensations in history. They're constantly breaking records and they have one of the most dedicated fan bases in the world known as Army. Their hit singles like “Boy With Love,” “Dynamite,” and “Butter” have been discussed on the show in the past for breaking through the US charts. But back in 2022, they decided to take a break from group activities and start releasing solo material because of their obligations to each fulfill mandatory military service in South Korea, precluding them from working together at the same time. Solo projects aren’t new for the group – BTS members have released mixtapes as far back as 2015 and countless solo singles – but this was the first time that BTS had ever announced a prolonged break. This moment, originally presented as a hiatus, has evolved into a whole new musical chapter for the group, with a seemingly endless array of new solo releases. Switched On Pop listens back to one track from each solo effort so far to introduce the casual listener to what is happening in this new era of BTS. Joining the show is Lenika Cruz, senior editor at The Atlantic, who literally wrote the book on BTS, simply called On BTS out on the Atlantic Editions imprint.\n\nSongs Discussed:\n\nj-hope, J. Cole - on the street\n\nJimin - Like Crazy\n\nRM, Youjeen - Wild Flower\n\nAgust D - People Pt.2\n\nAgust D - People\n\nJung Kook - Dreamers\n\nJIN - The Astronaut\n\nBTS - Singularity, Inner Child\n\nColdplay, BTS - My Universe\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Together, their song “Shakira: BZRP Music Sessions, Vol. 53,” is layered with musical and lyrical references, from the callbacks to “She Wolf” to the multiple beat switches. It also works to play into something larger: something akin to a pop music conspiracy.

      "description": "If you’ve ever learned classical piano, you probably tried to play one of Bach’s Inventions. The composer wrote fifteen pieces containing the most important fifteen keys in order to teach his son the fundamentals of piano and composition. Today, they remain some of the most popular pieces of piano music. Acclaimed jazz pianist Dan Tepfer recently revisited his childhood music books seeing them in a way he’d never realized as a student: the Inventions are much more than novice piano works.\n\nFor Tepfer, each of the Inventions not only highlight masterful command over harmony and counterpoint, but also contain moving character arcs that resemble the hero’s journey. A character is introduced at home in place of safety in act I. And then they are thrust into chaos and must overcome unsurmountable challenges in Act II. Finally, in Act III, our hero overcomes their final battle and returns home transformed by the journey. Once Tepfer heard this character arc, he started to apply it to his own free improv.\n\nThrough studying Bach, Tepfer conceived a new album: Inventions / Reinventions. In this project Tepfer fills in the missing keys from the Bach to complete all twenty four keys (there are twelve major and twelve minor keys) while updating the music with modern improvisation. In this conversation Tepfer walks co-host Charlie Harding through his process of playing Bach and applying it to jazz improv.\n\nListen to Dan Tepfer’s Inventions / Reinventions on StorySound Records\nListen to Into It with Sam Sanders on Fair Use\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Everyone will describe the music of 100 gecs differently. To some, Dylan Brady and Laura Les make deeply satisfying earworms, tracks able to scratch the itches that occupy the deepest memory-holed corners of the brain. To others, though, their music is an \"anarchic assault on the ears,” a quilt of all of the genres historically ridiculed in the popular canon: nu-metal, scuzz-rock, ska and 90’s pop punk are all fair game in the world of gecs.\n\nOn their latest record, aptly titled 10000 gecs, Brady and Les double down on the crunchy distortion and harmonics, creating tracks equally influenced by Primus and Eddie Van Halen as they are by their hyperpop contemporaries. The album reflects a Internet-core approach to music as a whole, shedding notions of “good” and “bad” music in favor of catchy melodies and intricate song construction. \n\nOn this episode on Switched On Pop, we dig deep into the ethos of 100 gecs, and producer Reanna Cruz talks to the duo themselves about their eclectic sophomore record.\n\nSongs discussed: \n\n\n100 gecs – Hollywood Baby\n\n100 gecs – Billy Knows Jamie\n\n100 gecs – stupid horse\n\n100 gecs – 745 sticky\n\n100 gecs – Doritos & Fritos\n\nPrimus – Jerry Was A Racecar Driver\n\nWeen – Bananas and Blow\n\nLimp Bizkit – My Generation\n\nGorillaz – Dirty Harry\n\nFuture – I Been Drinking\n\nJ-Kwon – Tipsy\n\nJustin Timberlake – Summer Love\n\nViolent Femmes – Added Up\n\n100 gecs – Dumbest Girl Alive\n\nTHX Deep Note\n\nCypress Hill – Insane in the Membrane\n\n100 gecs – The Most Wanted Person in the United States\n\n100 gecs – Frog on the Floor\n\nAlan Jackson – Chattahoochee\n\nLimp Bizkit – Dad Vibes\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "“Kiss From a Rose” is one of the most unusual number one hits of all time. Seal’s song can’t decide if it’s in minor or major, it uses an old-fashioned waltz rhythm, and its lush orchestration and elaborate vocal harmonies support mysterious lyrics about a “greying tower alone on the sea.” Seal himself wasn’t sure about the song, and needed some convincing to include the composition on his 1994 album SEAL II. But once director Joel Schumacher decided to use the track for the end credits of the film Batman Forever, the song went global and has remained a cultural phenomenon ever since. Ahead of his upcoming 30th anniversary tour for the albums SEAL I and SEAL II, we speak with the singer and songwriter about the enduring appeal of “Kiss From A Rose.”\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "“Take Me Home, Country Roads” is a song about West Virginia, but its message of homecoming has resonance far beyond Appalachia. Songwriter and producer Ian Fitchuk found this out when he was requested to perform Denver’s music at a music festival in Tibet. Fitchuk discovered that Denver has a huge following in East and South East Asia, where Denver toured multiple times from the 70s through the 90s. Denver’s songs first came to the region through the US Armed Forces Network radio as well as a diplomatic performance for China’s leader Deng Xiaoping at the Kennedy Center in 1979. Denver performed alongside the Harlem Globetrotters and the Joffrey ballet, and he left such an impression, the show led to an invitation to be one of the first western musicians to tour China. To better understand Denver’s meaning in the region, Switched On Pop co-host Charlie Harding speaks with Ian Fitchuk about his performance and interviews journalist Jason Jeung who wrote about “Country Roads” in The Atlantic.\n\nSongs Discussed\n\nJohn Denver - Take Me Home, Country Roads\n\nKacey Musgraves - Oh, What A World\n\nThe East Is Red\n\nJohn Denver - Rocky Mountain High\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival - Fortunate Son\n\nJames Taylor - Carolina in My Mind\n\nCarpenters - (They Long To Be) Close To You\n\nJohn Denver - Thank God I'm a Country Boy\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Five years ago, Los Angeles rapper Nipsey Hussle released Victory Lap, his only full length album. It was the high point of a career stretching back to the mid 2000s, when Hussle started releasing mixtapes on his own record label — mixtapes that brought him respect from artists like Jay-Z and Kendrick Lamar, but were not widely heard. \nVictory Lap brought him both the critical acclaim and commercial success he deserved — It hit #2 on the Billboard 200, and was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rap Album. But only a little over a year after its release, Hussle was shot to death outside his clothing store and community center in Crenshaw. In some ways, Hussle’s tragic end has overshadowed his incredible life as a musician and community activist.\nIn this conversation with Justin Tinsley, host of the podcast King of Crenshaw, we listen deeply to Victory Lap to hear Nipsey’s identity as an artist and consider the legacy of his debut album on its 5th anniversary.\nSongs Discussed\nNipsey Hussle - Victory Lap, Dedication, Hussle and Motivate, Last Time That I Checc'd, Real Big\nArctic Monkeys - Knee Socks\nJay-Z - Hard Knock Life\nSnoop Dogg - Y'all Gone Miss Me\nMore\nListen to the King of Crenshaw podcast.\nCheck out more of Justin's work\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "“Flowers” by Miley Cyrus is spending another week on top of the Billboard 100 – quite fitting for Valentine’s Day.\n\nThe disco-country track has gotten people talking for a few reasons, but most notably, Cyrus invokes Bruno Mars’ classic “When I Was Your Man” in both lyrical and melodic allusions. The connection between the two songs is not one of interpolation, but rather, Miley is responding to Bruno’s hit through her own words: making “Flowers” an answer song. \n\nThis episode of Switched On Pop, we take a deeper look at “Flowers” and how it fits in the canon of response songs throughout history, from classics like “This Land is Your Land” to Nicki Minaj’s “Anaconda.” \n\nSongs Discussed: \n\nMiley Cyrus – Flowers\n\nKacey Musgraves – High Horse\n\nGloria Gaynor – I Will Survive\n\nDua Lipa – New Rules\n\nBruno Mars – When I Was Your Man\n\nEd Sheeran – Shape of You\n\nTLC – No Scrubs\n\nKaty Perry, Snoop Dogg – California Girls\n\nJAY-Z, Alicia Keys – Empire State of Mind\n\nBig Mama Thornton – Hound Dog\n\nRufus Thomas – Bear Cat\n\nHank Thompson – The Wild Side of Life\n\nKitty Wells – It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\n\nRay Charles – Hit the Road, Jack\n\nNina Simone – Come on Back Jack\n\nThe Chantels – Well, I Told You\n\nUTFO – Roxanne, Roxanne\n\nRoxanne Shanté – Roxanne’s Revenge\n\nUTFO – The Real Roxanne\n\nNew Edition – Candy Girl\n\nThe Jackson 5 – ABC\n\nSir Mix-A-Lot – Baby Got Back\n\nNicki Minaj – Anaconda\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "In 2010, a photographer named Reuben Cox moved to Los Angeles to start Old Style Guitar Shop. In the years since, the instruments that he continues to repair and sell have come to define the sound of the LA indie folk scene among artists like Blake Mills, Andrew Bird, Madison Cunningham, Ethan Gruska and Phoebe Bridgers.\n\nReuben’s guitars are Frankenstein-esque creations, cobbled together from spare parts and neglected guitar bodies found in flea markets and estate sales. The sounds that these make, though, are as eccentric as their source: the strings are laid on top of Reuben’s signature, a rubber bridge.\n\nThis sound, and the mythos of the rubber bridge guitar, has turned Reuben into a local celebrity and put Old Style at the center of Los Angeles’s indie music scene. In this episode of Switched on Pop, host Charlie Harding explores that sound and the man behind it all.\n\nSongs Discussed (playlist)\n\nTaylor Swift - champagne problems\n\nOlivia Rodrigo - hope ur ok\n\nboygenius - Emily I’m Sorry\n\nJenny Owen Youngs - Vampire Weeknight\n\nAndrew Bird - The New Saint Jude\n\nMarcus Mumford - Only Child\n\nPerfume Genius - Slip Away\n\nAndrew Bird - Underlands\n\nMadison Cunningham - Anywhere\n\nMadison Cunningham - Life According to Raechel\n\nPhoebe Bridgers - Garden Song\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "In 1988, Bobby McFerrin recorded a song a cappella with a simple message: not to worry, and just enjoy life. That song, aptly titled “Don’t Worry, Be Happy,” topped the charts and become one of the most well known one-hit wonders of all time. \n\nIn doing so, it also propelled McFerrin into the spotlight, winning him three Grammy awards and an eternal place in pop culture. His career, though, is more than just the Big Mouth Billy Bass: a deep dive reveals an incredible career in jazz, folk, and classical music as well as a remarkable command of his own voice. This episode of Switched on Pop, we explore the history behind \"Don't Worry, Be Happy\" and the ensuing legacy of Bobby McFerrin.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
